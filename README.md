# object-detection
Basic Yolo object detection implementation based on Pytorch.

The model is Imagenet trained RESNET-18 with the input layer and the FC layers suitably modified to fit the Yolo use case.
At this time we have trained the model on PASCAL database just for learning purpose. Plan is to gradually move it to MS COCO dataset oneday!

This work is derived from Aladdin Persson's work on Yolo(link below). We acknowledge and are grateful for his contribution.
